# Note below

* do `source bin/activate` to activate python3.7 virtual environment before install/update python module upon existing one
* Do changes on dev branch and do `mkdocs gh-deploy` command ourside of docs-folder to enable so that they can implement .yml configuration file properly
* Then the new branch gh-pages will be made autonomatically, `Don't change directly on that branch whenever you supposed to change the doc's content`
* Please change on dev branch and do the same procedure from step 2 (delete gh-pages branch if necessary)

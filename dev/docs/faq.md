# Frequently asked questions
## Do you support on-premise or are you cloud only?
We support both the cloud and an on-premise version. You can pick the version you want depending on your security and scale needs.
## Can `Test Scripts` be exported to Selenium?
Yes, Selenium Scripts are supported out of the box and can be downloaded to your local or cloud environments.
## Is change management supported?
Web page/asset changes within reason are supported. Our algorithms figure out what has changed and what is needed to make your tests continue running.
## How long does the system take to train against my environment?
While `TestIQ` can work off the box in any environment, efficiently working on your environment requires a couple of weeks
## What makes you unique?
We can work on your web application, allow you to specify your tests in natural language

* Export all our generated tests to Selenium
* Track your application for changes and ensure within reason that your tests are still working

Also, We have a fully autonomous testing solution available within our labs environment. We are planning to make this available to GA soon.
## Do you have a Jenkins Plugin?
Yes! Please refer to the release page.
## What if I don't have any tests written in English?
We allow users to create tests using our test studio. This is ideal when you don't have tests and are willing to click through a business process sequence.
## How many tests can you run in parallel?
The number of tests in parallel can scale up effectively in our cloud version. For our on-premise version, the number of parallel tests depends on the number of containers you can deploy.
## What is your [pricing](pricing.md)?
It's good to have as much as you give :)

**Test Creation and Maintenance**

Creating test cases, data, and scripts only take minutes instead of days with AutonomIQ's TestIQ. As changes occur, TestIQ impact analysis quickly identifies testing problems and self-corrects test assets.

**Reduced time**

The AutonomIQ solution can easily run tests against different environments, devices, and browsers. Head to head tests between the AutonomiQ platform and incumbent automation tools results in a cycle time reduction from 200 hours to just 5 hours.

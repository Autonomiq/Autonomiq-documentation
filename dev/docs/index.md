* *Generate script*
######Creating test cases, data, and scripts only take minutes instead of hours (or days) with AutonomIQ. As changes occur, AutonomIQ impact analysis quickly identifies them and self-corrects the test assets to prevent false positives and script issues.

* *Shorten the Time*
######The AutonomIQ solution can easily run tests against different environments, devices, and browsers. Head to head tests between the AutonomiQ platform and incumbent automation tools results in a cycle time reduction from 200 hours to just 5 hours.

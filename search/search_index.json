Which AutonomiQ can help you? AutonomiQ is an autonomous platform that automates every step fo the testing life-cycle from test case creation to impact analysis. Generate script Creating test cases, data, and scripts only take minutes instead of hours (or days) with AutonomIQ. As changes occur, AutonomIQ impact analysis quickly identifies them and self-corrects the test assets to prevent false positives and script issues. Shorten the Time The AutonomIQ solution can easily run tests against different environments, devices, and browsers. Head to head tests between the AutonomiQ platform and incumbent automation tools results in a cycle time reduction from 200 hours to just 5 hours.

We support both the cloud and an on-premise version. You can pick the version you want depending on your security and scale needs. Can Test Scripts be exported to Selenium? Yes, Selenium Scripts are supported out of the box and can be downloaded to your local or cloud environments. Is change management supported? Web page/asset changes within reason are supported. Our algorithms figure out what has changed and what is needed to make your tests continue running. How long does the system take to train against my environment? While TestIQ can work off the box in any environment, efficiently working on your environment requires a couple of weeks What makes you unique? We can work on your web application, allow you to specify your tests in natural language Export all our generated tests to Selenium Track your application for changes and ensure within reason that your tests are still working Also, We have a fully autonomous testing solution available within our labs environment. We are planning to make this available to GA soon. Do you have a Jenkins Plugin? Yes! Please refer to the release page. What if I don't have any tests written in English? We allow users to create tests using our test studio. This is ideal when you don't have tests and are willing to click through a business process sequence. How many tests can you run in parallel? The number of tests in parallel can scale up effectively in our cloud version. For our on-premise version, the number of parallel tests depends on the number of containers you can deploy. What is your pricing ? It's good to have as much as you give :) I want to know more Some further background documentation * Get in touch with sales@autonomiq.io","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"faq/#do-you-support-on-premise-or-are-you-cloud-only","text":"We support both the cloud and an on-premise version.
